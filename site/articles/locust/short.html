In my search for a scalable, session based, highly configurable load testing
tool, I happened upon Locust.  Looking for something between the lightweight
but pure throughput testing of <em>ab</em> and full on virtual machine scripted
browser transactions.  Locust looked to fit the bill, and so far has done
everything I have needed, both for quasi-functional testing as well as
benchmarking API endpoints.  A great departure from the normal heavyweight
<em>The Grinder</em>, Locust provided a lightweight, yet totally functional
approach to user emulation testing.
