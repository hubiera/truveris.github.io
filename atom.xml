		<summary>Introduction to testing web applications using locust; replacing users with small scripts.</summary>

				In my search for a scalable, session based, highly configurable load testing
tool, I happened upon Locust.  I was Looking for something between the 
lightweight but pure throughput testing of <em>ab</em> and full on virtual 
machine scripted browser transactions.  Locust looked to fit the bill, and so

heavyweight <em>The Grinder</em>, Locust provided a lightweight, yet totally
functional approach to user emulation testing.
